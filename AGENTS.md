# Agent guide — Relaybase

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository. Read the linked docs **before** changing the areas they cover.

## Required reading by area

| When you are changing… | Read first |
|------------------------|------------|
| Email Cmd+K, row context menus, mail action shortcuts, or anything under `app/src/email/commands/` | [docs/email-command-system.md](docs/email-command-system.md) |
| BIMI / VMC / “logo in Gmail” / inbox brand marks | [docs/bimi-vmc-do-not-build.md](docs/bimi-vmc-do-not-build.md) (do **not** build) |

## Email commands (summary)

Mail actions must stay centralized in `app/src/email/commands/`:

- Static defs → resolve/run store → adapter → Cmd+K + context menu + command hotkeys
- Show **available-only** commands (selection-filtered); do not dump dashboard “Open …” nav into mail Cmd+K
- Keep app-layer ⌘K (capture) separate from mail-layer `j`/`k` shortcuts

Full rules, file map, and add-command checklist: **[docs/email-command-system.md](docs/email-command-system.md)**.

## General

- Prefer existing module boundaries; do not re-scatter command logic into `MailListView`.
- Do not commit secrets. Do not force-push `main`.
- Match existing pnpm / OpenNext / shadcn patterns in the repo.
